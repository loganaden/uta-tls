<abstract>
<t>This specification updates current recommendation for the use of
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to provide confidentiality of email
between a Mail User Agent (MUA) and a Mail Submission Server or Mail Access
Server. This document updates RFC8314.
</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t><xref target="RFC8314"/> defines the minimum recommended version for  TLS as version 1.1.
Due to the deprecation of TLS 1.1 in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate"></xref>,
this recommendation is no longer valid. Therefore this document updates <xref target="RFC8314"/>
so that the minimum version for TLS is TLS 1.2.

	<t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	  document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/> when they
	  appear in ALL CAPS.  These words may also appear in this document in
	  lower case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.

In Section 4.1, the text should be revised from:
"It is RECOMMENDED that new users be required to use TLS version 1.1
   or greater from the start.  However, an MSP may find it necessary to
   make exceptions to accommodate some legacy systems that support only
   earlier versions of TLS or only cleartext."

   earlier versions of TLS or only cleartext."
</t>
<t>OLD:</t>

"
 If, however, an MUA provides such an indication, it
      MUST NOT indicate confidentiality for any connection that does not
      at least use TLS 1.1 with certificate verification and also meet
      the minimum confidentiality requirements associated with that
      account.

MUAs MUST implement TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> or later.  Earlier TLS and

   The default minimum expected level of confidentiality for all new
   accounts MUST require successful validation of the server's
   certificate and SHOULD require negotiation of TLS version 1.2 or
   greater.  (Future revisions to this specification may raise these
   requirements or impose additional requirements to address newly
   discovered weaknesses in protocols or cryptographic algorithms.
