<abstract>
<t>This specification updates current recommendation for the use of
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to provide confidentiality of email
between a Mail User Agent (MUA) and a Mail Submission Server or Mail Access
Server. This document updates RFC8314.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t><xref target="RFC8314"/> defines the minimum recommended for TLS as version 1.1.
Due to the deprecation of TLS 1.1 in draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate,
this recommendation is no longer valid. Therefore this document updates <xref target="RFC8314"/>
so that the minimum version for TLS is TLS 1.2.

In the Table of contents section, the text should be revised from:

In section 4, the text should be revised from:
"As soon as practicable, MSPs currently supporting Secure Sockets
      Layer (SSL) 2.x, SSL 3.0, or TLS 1.0 SHOULD transition their users
      to TLS 1.1 or later and discontinue support for those earlier
      versions of SSL and TLS." to:

In Section 4.1, the text should be revised from:
"It is RECOMMENDED that new users be required to use TLS version 1.1
   or greater from the start.  However, an MSP may find it necessary to
   make exceptions to accommodate some legacy systems that support only
   earlier versions of TLS or only cleartext."

In section 5, the text should be revised from:

MUAs SHOULD provide a prominent indication of the level of
      confidentiality associated with an account configuration that is
      appropriate for the user interface (for example, a "lock" icon or
      changed background color for a visual interface, or some sort of
      audible indication for an audio user interface), at appropriate
      times and/or locations, in order to inform the user of the
      confidentiality of the communications associated with that
      account.  For example, this might be done whenever (a) the user is
      prompted for authentication credentials, (b) the user is composing
      mail that will be sent to a particular submission server, (c) a
      list of accounts is displayed (particularly if the user can select
      from that list to read mail), or (d) the user is asking to view or
      update any configuration data that will be stored on a remote
      server.  If, however, an MUA provides such an indication, it
      MUST NOT indicate confidentiality for any connection that does not
      at least use TLS 1.1 with certificate verification and also meet
      the minimum confidentiality requirements associated with that
      account.

In Section 5 the text should be revised from:

In Section 5.2 second paragraph, the text should be revised from:
